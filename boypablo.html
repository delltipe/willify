            <h2>Lyrics</h2>
            <h3>
                [Verse 1]<br>
                The flowers wither<br>
                And the clouds grow bigger<br>
                Up in the garden alone, I'm freezing, but it's fine<br>
                'Cause I'm thinking of you<br>
                And all of the things we could do<br>
                Running as fast as I can, glad I forgot to tie my shoes<br>

                <br>[Pre-Chorus]<br>
                Falling isn't really that bad<br>
                If it's for you<br>
                Your lips, your blush, your eyes, your touch<br>

                <br>[Chorus]<br>
                Baby, you are really something else<br>
                'Cause I don't think I have smiled like this before<br>
                When I spend my time with you it tends to stop<br>
                Honey, being around you is all I need<br>
                Baby<br>

                <br>[Verse 2]<br>
                Don't worry 'bout me<br>
                It's not as cold as it seems<br>
                So good to be the one who keeps you warm<br>
                These days, we're all good though<br>
                We're walking under clouds, honey<br>
                Most of the time<br>
                I can't believe my own eyes<br>
                
                <br>[Pre-Chorus]<br>
                Lookin' at you feels like a dream<br>
                Please, stay right here<br>
                Your lips, your blush, your eyes, your touch<br>

                <br>[Chorus]<br>
                Baby, you are really something else<br>
                'Cause I don't think I have smiled like this before<br>
                When I spend my time with you it tends to stop<br>
                Honey, being around you is all I need<br>
                Baby
