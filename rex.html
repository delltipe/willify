            <h2>Short Description</h2>
            <h3>
                NME described the song as a "slow-burning cut of emotive pop", 
                while NPR described the song as a "semi-downtempo acoustic track" 
                where Rex Orange County meditates on "the existential", singing; 
                "What if all this counts for nothing, everything I thought I'd be/
                What if by the time I realize, it's too far to see?". 
                Lyrically, the song is about Rex fantasizing a future life with his lover, 
                and includes subtle remarks from Rex Orange County about becoming famous 
                as a teenager; "I'm still a boy inside my thoughts / Am I meant to understand my faults?"

            <h3>
                [Verse 1]<br>
                The great protector<br>
                Is that what I'm supposed to be?<br>
                What if all this counts for nothing<br>
                Everything I thought I'd be?<br>
                What if by the time I realize<br>
                It's too far behind to see?<br>
                Seventy-mil projector<br>
                I can show you everything, yeah<br>
                And we're on our way to glory<br>
                Where the show won't ever end<br>
                And the encore lasts forever<br>
                And it's time we're due to spend<br>
                
                <br>[Verse 2]<br>
                Spending the years together<br>
                Growing older every day (Every day)<br>
                I feel at home when I'm around you<br>
                And I'll gladly say again<br>
                I hope the encore lasts forever<br>
                Now there's time for us to spend<br>
                And it's sublime with you, my friend<br>
                This right here still feels like a honeymoon<br>
                When you say my name, nothing's changed<br>
                I'm still a boy inside my thoughts<br>
                Am I meant to understand my faults?<br>

                <br>[Chorus]<br>
                I don't think so<br>
                I don't think I'm meant to understand myself<br>
                Maybe you do<br>
                And that's good for you<br>
                Maybe in time<br>
                Maybe one day<br>
                I'll do the same<br>
                (I'll do the same<br>
                I'll do the same<br>
                I'll do the same)<br>
                
                <br>[Bridge]<br>
                I'll do the same as you<br>
                I'll try and hold it up<br>
                Soon I hope<br>
                Or as soon as I'm old enough<br>
                (Old enough to understand<br>
                Old enough to understand)<br>
                
                <br>[Outro]<br>
                Stay forever, you know more than anyone (Yeah, whoa)<br>
                And it's you that knows my darkness<br>
                And you know my bedroom needs<br>
                You could blast me and my secrets<br>
                But there's probably just no need
