            <h3>
                [Intro]<br>
                Woah-oh-oh<br>
                Tell 'em that we do it for the '90s<br>

                <br>[Verse 1]<br>
                It's our generation, we need conversation<br>
                In a nation with no communication<br>
                A little easy baked, and<br>
                We're kind of lost, yeah<br>
                But we're on a break, man<br>
                Rachel and Ross said<br>

                <br>[Pre-Chorus]<br>
                We're going down with the ship, Leonardo<br>
                Put on your 'Boks and your Docs and we'll kick it at the bar<br>
                No cash, but we turn it up to ten though<br>
                Fam, I'm just tryna get super smashed, Nintendo<br>

                <br>[Chorus]<br>
                So, light it up, up, we're hella fucked up<br>
                Take a hit, me one more time like Britney, bitch<br>
                Bottoms up, up, herе's to us<br>
                Tell 'em that we do it for thе '90s kids<br>
                Woah-oh-oh<br>
                Tell 'em that we do it for the '90s kids<br>
                Woah-oh-oh<br>
                Tell 'em that we do it for the '90s<br>

                <br>[Verse 2]<br>
                Chillin' on the rooftop<br>
                S'mores and Bratz Dolls<br>
                Wait, s'more-what?<br>
                You're killing me, Smalls<br>
                (You're killing me, Smalls)<br>

                <br>[Pre-Chorus]<br>
                We're going down with the ship, Leonardo<br>
                Put on your 'Boks and your Docs and we'll kick it at the bar<br>
                No cash, but we turn it up to ten though<br>
                Fam, I'm just tryna get super smashed, Nintendo<br>

                <br>[Chorus]<br>
                So, light it up, up, we're hella fucked up<br>
                Take a hit, me one more time like Britney, bitch<br>
                Bottoms up, up, here's to us<br>
                Tell 'em that we do it for the '90s kids<br>
                Woah-oh-oh<br>
                Tell 'em that we do it for the '90s kids<br>
                Woah-oh-oh<br>
                Tell 'em that we do it for the '90s<br>

                <br>[Bridge]<br>
                Do you got a Tamagotchi?<br>
                Like, a real Tamagotchi<br>
                'Cause you know I tama-got you<br>
                If you tama-got me<br>
                Oh no, it died<br>

                <br>[Chorus]<br>
                So, light it up, up, we're hella fucked up<br>
                Take a hit, me one more time like Britney, bitch<br>
                Bottoms up, up, here's to us<br>
                Tell 'em that we do it for the '90s kids<br>
                Woah-oh-oh<br>
                Tell 'em that we do it for the '90s kids<br>
                Woah-oh-oh<br>
