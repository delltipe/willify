            <h2>Short Description</h2>
            <h3>
                "Not Like Us" is Kendrick Lamar's fourth diss track directed at Drake, 
                released on the evening of May 4, 2024, less than 24 hours after 
                the release of "meet the grahams", his third dedicated diss. On the track, 
                Kendrick avenges the West Coast for Drake's controversial use of 2Pac and 
                Snoop Dogg A.I. vocals on his song "Taylor Made Freestyle", Drake's second diss 
                released via Instagram on April 19, 2024. It was removed shortly thereafter because of 
                a cease-and-desist from the estate of the late Tupac Shakur.

            <h3>
                [Intro]<br>
                Psst, I see dead people<br>
                (Mustard on the beat, ho)<br>

                <br>[Verse 1]<br>
                Ayy, Mustard on the beat, ho<br>
                Deebo any rap nigga, he a free throw<br>
                Man down, call an amberlamps, tell him, "Breathe, bro"<br>
                Nail a nigga to the cross, he walk around like Teezo<br>
                What's up with these jabroni-ass niggas tryna see Compton?<br>
                The industry can hate me, fuck 'em all and they mama<br>
                How many opps you really got? I mean, it's too many options<br>
                I'm finna pass on this body, I'm John Stockton<br>
                Beat your ass and hide the Bible if God watchin'<br>
                Sometimes you gotta pop out and show niggas<br>
                Certified boogeyman, I'm the one that up the score with 'em<br>
                Walk him down, whole time, I know he got some ho in him<br>
                Pole on him, extort shit, bully Death Row on him<br>
                Say, Drake, I hear you like 'em young<br>
                You better not ever go to cell block one<br>
                To any bitch that talk to him and they in love<br>
                Just make sure you hide your lil' sister from him<br>
                They tell me Chubbs the only one that get your hand-me-downs<br>
                And Party at the party playin' with his nose now<br>
                And Baka got a weird case, why is he around?<br>
                Certified Lover Boy? Certified pedophiles<br>
                Wop, wop, wop, wop, wop, Dot, fuck 'em up<br>
                Wop, wop, wop, wop, wop, I'ma do my stuff<br>
                Why you trollin' like a bitch? Ain't you tired?<br>
                Tryna strike a chord and it's probably A minor<br>

                <br>[Chorus]<br>
                They not like us, they not like us, they not like us<br>
                They not like us, they not like us, they not like us<br>

                <br>[Verse 2]<br>
                You think the Bay gon' let you disrespect Pac, nigga?<br>
                I think that Oakland show gon' be your last stop, nigga<br>
                Did Cole fouI, I don't know why you still pretendin'<br>
                What is the owl? Bird niggas and bird bitches, go<br>
                The audience not dumb<br>
                Shape the stories how you want, hey, Drake, they're not slow<br>
                Rabbit hole is still deep, I can go further, I promise<br>
                Ain't that somethin'? B-Rad stands for bitch and you Malibu most wanted<br>
                Ain't no law, boy, you ball boy, fetch Gatorade or somethin'<br>
                Since 2009, I had this bitch jumpin'<br>
                You niggas'll get a wedgie, be flipped over your boxers<br>
                What OVO for? The "Other Vaginal Option"? Pussy<br>
                Nigga better straighten they posture, got famous all up in Compton<br>
                Might write this for the doctorate, tell the pop star, "Quit hidin'"<br>
                Fuck a caption, want action, no accident<br>
                And I'm hands-on, he fuck around, get polished<br>
                Fucked on Wayne girl while he was in jail, that's connivin'<br>
                Then get his face tatted like a bitch apologizin'<br>
                I'm glad DeRoz' came home, y'all didn't deserve him neither<br>
                From Alondra down to Central, nigga better not speak on Serena<br>
                And your homeboy need subpoena, that predator move in flocks<br>
                That name gotta be registered and placed on neighborhood watch<br>
                I lean on you niggas like another line of Wock'<br>
                Yeah, it's all eyes on me, and I'ma send it up to Pac, ayy<br>
                Put the wrong label on me, I'ma get 'em dropped, ayy<br>
                Sweet Chin Music and I won't pass the aux, ayy<br>
                How many stocks do I really have in stock? Ayy<br>
                One, two, three, four, five, plus five, ayy<br>
                Devil is a lie, he a 69 God, ayy<br>
                Freaky-ass niggas need to stay they ass inside, ayy<br>
                Roll they ass up like a fresh pack of 'za, ayy<br>
                City is back up, it's a must, we outside, ayy<br>

                <br>[Chorus]<br>
                They not like us, they not like us, they not like us<br>
                They not like us, they not like us, they not like us<br>

                <br>[Verse 3]<br>
                Once upon a time, all of us was in chains<br>
                Homie still doubled down callin' us some slaves<br>
                Atlanta was the Mecca, buildin' railroads and trains<br>
                Bear with me for a second, let me put y'all on game<br>
                The settlers was usin' townfolk to make 'em richer<br>
                Fast-forward, 2024, you got the same agenda<br>
                You run to Atlanta when you need a check balance<br>
                Let me break it down for you, this the real nigga challenge<br>
                You called Future when you didn't see the club (Ayy, what?)<br>
                Lil Baby helped you get your lingo up (What?)<br>
                21 gave you false street cred<br>
                Thug made you feel like you a slime in your head (Ayy, what?)<br>
                Quavo said you can be from Northside (What?)<br>
                2 Chainz say you good, but he liedYou run to Atlanta when you need a few dollars<br>
                No, you not a colleague, you a fuckin' colonizer<br>
                The family matter and the truth of the matter<br>
                It was God's plan to show y'all the liar<br>

                <br>[Bridge]<br>
                Mm<br>
                Mm-mm<br>
                He a fan, he a fan, he a fan (Mm)<br>
                He a fan, he a fan, he a<br>
                Freaky-ass nigga, he a 69 God<br>
                Freaky-ass nigga, he a 69 God<br>
                Hey, hey, hey, hey, run for your life<br>
                Hey, hey, hey, hey, run for your life<br>
                Freaky-ass nigga, he a 69 God<br>
                Freaky-ass nigga, he a 69 God<br>
                Hey, hey, hey, hey, run for your life<br>
                Hey, hey, hey, hey, run for your life<br>
                Let me hear you say, "OV-ho" (OV-ho)<br>
                Say, "OV-ho" (OV-ho)<br>
                Then step this way, step that way<br>
                Then step this way, step that way<br>

                <br>[Outro]<br>
                Are you my friend?<br>
                Are we locked in?<br>
                Then step this way, step that way<br>
                Then step this way, step that way
