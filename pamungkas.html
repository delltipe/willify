            <h3>
                [Verse 1]<br>
                Oh<br>
                There you are<br>
                Sittin' still all stripes and lonely<br>
                Hidin', wishin', waitin'<br>
                While I'm<br>
                Here I am<br>
                Standin' still stare at you only<br>
                Everythin' gets blurry<br>

                <br>[Pre-Chorus]<br>
                All I want is just to stay<br>
                You can't shake me, I would never dare<br>
                Let go<br>
                Through the talkin' and the walkin'<br>
                I will give you all my lovin'<br>

                <br>[Chorus]<br>
                Start countin' all the days<br>
                Forever I will stay with you<br>
                With you, one only you<br>
                Go far and roam about<br>
                Comeback and callin' out to me<br>
                To me, one only me<br>

                <br>[Verse 2]<br>
                Oh<br>
                I'm in love<br>
                What did I do to deserve you?<br>
                You tell me what did I do<br>
                To be<br>
                With you, love<br>
                To be the one you're runnin' into<br>
                When the days do come through<br>

                <br>[Pre-Chorus]<br>
                All I want is just to stay<br>

                I will give you all my lovin'<br>
                (all of my, all the good lovin')<br>

                <br>[Chorus]<br>
                Start countin' all the days<br>
                Forever I will stay with you<br>
