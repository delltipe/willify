            <h2>Short Description</h2>
            <h3>
                Beihold clams she wrote the single due to 
                the pills she was taking for her anxiety, 
                and how they made her feel “numb.” 
                While she's thrilled that fans are telling her 
                how much they relate to the song, 
                she also believes it has negative commentary on our society 
                - “Everyone expects me to be the happiest ever 
                because the song is blowing up and I'm so grateful,” she explains, 
                “but, I've been numb, because I don't know how to process it!” 
                Although Beihold claims she no longer takes 
                the initially mentioned medication, 
                she admits she still feels a little like a “numb little bug.”

            <h3>
                [Verse 1]<br>
                I don't feel a single thing<br>
                Have the pills done too much?<br>
                Haven't caught up with my friends in weeks<br>
                And now we're outta touch<br>
                I've been drivin' in L.A<br>
                And the world, it feels too big<br>
                Like a floating ball that's bound to break<br>
                Snap my psyche like a twig<br>
                
                <br>[Pre-Chorus]<br>
                And I just wanna see<br>
                If you feel the same as me<br>

                <br>[Chorus]<br>
                Do you ever get a little bit tired of life?<br>
                Like you're not really happy but you don't wanna die<br>
                Like you're hangin' by a thread but you gotta survive<br>
                'Cause you gotta survive<br>
                Like your body's in the room but you're not really there<br>
                Like you have empathy inside but you don't really care<br>
                Like you're fresh outta love but it's been in the air<br>
                Am I past repair?<br>

                <br>[Post-Chorus]<br>
                A little bit tired of trying to care when I don't<br>
                A little bit tired of quick repairs to cope<br>
                A little bit tired of sinkin', there's water in my boat<br>
                I'm barely breathin', tryna stay afloat<br>
                So I got these quick repairs to cope<br>
                Guess I'm just broken and broke<br>

                <br>[Verse 2]<br>
                The prescription's on its way<br>
                With a name I can't pronounce<br>
                And the dose I gotta take<br>
                Boy, I wish that I could count<br>

                <br>[Pre-Chorus]<br>
                'Cause I just wanna see<br>
                If this could make me happy<br>

                <br>[Chorus]<br>
                Do you ever get a little bit tired of life?<br>
                Like you're not really happy but you don't wanna die<br>
                Like you're hangin' by a thread but you gotta survive<br>
                'Cause you gotta survive<br>
                Like your body's in the room but you're not really there<br>
                Like you have empathy inside but you don't really care<br>
                Like you're fresh outta love but it's been in the air<br>
                Am I past repair?<br>

                <br>[Post-Chorus]<br>
                A little bit tired of trying to care when I don't<br>
                A little bit tired of quick repairs to cope<br>
                A little bit tired of sinkin', there's water in my boat<br>
                I'm barely breathin', tryna stay afloat<br>
                So I got these quick repairs to cope<br>

                <br>[Outro]<br>
                Do you ever get a little bit tired of life?<br>
                Like you're not really happy but you don't wanna die<br>
                Like a numb little bug that's gotta survive<br>
                That's gotta survive
