            <h2>Short Description</h2>
            <h3>
                The song captures the theme of late-night communication, 
                particularly through text messages, often fueled by alcohol and raw emotions. 
                Released in 2019, "Drunk Text" combines moody melodies with introspective lyrics, 
                exploring the vulnerability and candidness that can come with inebriated communication. 
                The song's relatable subject matter and emotive delivery resonate with listeners 
                who have experienced similar moments of impulsive expression.

                [Verse 1]<br>
                5th of November<br>
                When I walked you home<br>
                That's when I nearly said it<br>
                But then said, "Forget it" and froze<br>
                Do you remember?<br>
                You probably don't<br>
                'Cause the sparks in the sky<br>
                Took a hold of your eyes while we spoke<br>

                <br>[Pre-Chorus]<br>
                Yesterday, drank way too much<br>
                And stayed up too late<br>
                Started to write what I wanna say<br>
                Deleted the message<br>
                But I still remember it said<br>

                <br>[Chorus]<br>
                I wish I was who you drunk texted at midnight<br>
                Wish I was the reason you stay up till three<br>
                And you can't fall asleep<br>
                Waiting for me to reply<br>
                I wish I was more than just someone you walk by<br>
                Wish I wasn't scared to be honest and open<br>
                Instead of just hoping<br>
                You'd feel what I'm feeling inside<br>

                <br>[Verse 2]<br>
                April the 7th<br>
                And nothing has changed<br>
                It's hard to get by<br>
                When you're still on my mind everyday<br>
                Sometimes I question<br>
                If you feel the same<br>
                Do we make stupid jokes?<br>
                Trying to hide that we're both too afraid to say<br>

                <br>[Chorus]<br>
                I wish I was who you drunk texted at midnight<br>
                Wish I was the reason you stay up till three<br>
                And you can't fall asleep<br>
                Waiting for me to reply<br>
                I wish I was more than just someone you walk by<br>
                Wish I wasn't scared to be honest and open<br>
                Instead of just hoping<br>
                You'd feel what I'm feeling inside<br>

                <br>[Bridge]<br>
                Oh, and here we go again<br>
                Destroy myself to keep a friend<br>
                Hiding away 'cause I was afraid you'd say no<br>
                I wonder if I cross your mind<br>
                Half as much as you do mine<br>
                If I tell you the truth<br>
                What will I lose? I don't know<br>

                <br>[Outro]<br>
                I wish I had sent you that drunk text at midnight<br>
                I was just scared it would ruin our friendship<br>
                But I really meant it<br>
                I wonder how you would reply
