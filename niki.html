            <h2>Short Description</h2>
            <h3>
                The song, performed by NIKI, explores unspoken feelings and 
                the vulnerabilities of love. The lyrics express admiration for someone, 
                inviting them to take a chance on a potential relationship. 
                It's a heartfelt plea for communication and a call to be brave 
                in matters of the heart. So, why not raise the stakes and embrace 
                the possibility of something real and meaningful?

            <h2>Lyrics</h2>
            <h3>
                [Verse 1]<br>
                His laugh you'd die for, his laugh you'd die for<br>
                The kind that colors the sky<br>
                Heart intangible<br>
                Slips away faster than dandelion fluff in the sunlight<br>
                And he's got swirls of passion in his eyes<br>
                Uncovering the dreams, he dreams at night<br>
                As much and hard as he tries to hide<br>
                I can see right through, see right through<br>

                <br>[Verse 2]<br>
                His voice you'd melt for, he says my name like<br>
                I'll fade away somehow if he's too loud<br>
                What I would give for me to get my feet<br>
                Back on the ground, head off the clouds<br>
                I laugh at how we're polar opposites<br>
                I read him like a book, and he's a clueless little kid<br>
                Doesn't know that I'd stop time and space<br>
                Just to make him smile, make him smile<br>

                <br>[Chorus]<br>
                Oh, why can't we for once<br>
                Say what we want, say what we feel?<br>
                Oh, why can't you for once<br>
                Disregard the world, and run to what you know is real?<br>
                Take a chance with me, take a chance with me<br>

                <br>[Verse 3]<br>
                His kiss you'd kill for<br>
                Just one and you're done for<br>
                Electricity surging in the air<br>
                He drives me crazy, it's so beyond me<br>
                How he'd look me dead in the eye and stay unaware<br>
                
                <br>[Pre-Chorus]<br>
                That I'm hopelessly captivated<br>
                By a boy who thinks love's overrated<br>
                How did I get myself in this arrangement?<br>
                It baffles me, too, baffles me, too<br>
                
                <br>[Chorus]<br>
                Oh, why can't we for once<br>
                Say what we want, say what we feel?<br>
                Oh, why can't you for once<br>
                Disregard the world, and run to what you know is real?<br>
                
                <br>[Bridge]<br>
                In the end, we only regret<br>
                The chances we didn't take<br>
                I'll be your safety net<br>
                So, why not raise the stakes?<br>
                And I can hear your heart from across the room<br>
                Pulsing through my veins<br>
                I know you need this, too<br>
                Lie to me all you please<br>
                I can see right through<br>
                See right through<br>

                <br>[Chorus]<br>
                Oh, why can't we for once<br>
                Say what we want, say what we feel?<br>
                Oh, why can't you for once<br>
                Disregard the world, and run to what you know is real?<br>
                Oh, why can't we for once<br>
                Say what we want, say what we feel?<br>
                Oh, why can't you for once<br>
                Disregard the world, and run to what you know is real?<br>
                Take a chance with me, take a chance with me
